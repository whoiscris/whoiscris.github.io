> It is not easy to be unique, to stand out, but it is the only thing worthwhile doing in one's lifetime.

> Hard work never results in regret.

> Don't try to convince people too much, if it's valuable for them they'll listen.

> Stay calm and sharp under pressure, no matter what! - True character is revealed in these moments.

> Distort reality until it catches up - be a dreamer and have ridiculous long-term goals, but work towards them.

> What if and if only - translates to: no fear, and no regrets.

> Have zero expectations and you'll be the happiest person alive.

> Be comfortable with being underestimated - and use it as a drive.

> Life can be mysterious to most. But it's simple; accept mortality voluntarily and transcend it.

> Figure out where you are, where you want to be, and what stops you from reaching there.
